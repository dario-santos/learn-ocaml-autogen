# Learn-OCaml autogen

This is Learn-OCaml autogen, a utility allowing you to generate all the files
needed by [Learn-OCaml](https://github.com/ocaml-sf/learn-ocaml) from a single
one. You might be interested in autogen if:
1) You need to write an exercise for the platform, but want to make it easy.
2) You want to avoid writing boilerplate code. Then,
   - if your exercise is a generic test of functions against solutions, you
     have nothing more to do.
   - if your exercise is more complex, you can use the generated files as a
     basis for your implementation.

## Installation

The procedure to install autogen is described [here](doc/installation.md).
